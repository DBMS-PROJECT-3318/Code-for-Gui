# Code-for-Gui

THE LoginGui java class is the most up to date and the one that will run with the SqliteConnect java class

in the SqliteConnect it might not run for you guys but that because when you download the DBMSPROJ file you will have to manually change the path in the SqliteConnect class so that it works for you.

give it a try and if stuff is not working for you let me know and I can help out.
